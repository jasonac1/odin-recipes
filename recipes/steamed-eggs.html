        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A simple and flexible recipe for a versatile Chinese dish.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 eggs (2/3 cup)</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>2/3 cup water</li>
            <li>2/3 cup chicken stock</li>
            <li>Sesame oil</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Crack 3 eggs in a liquid measuring cup.</li>
            <li>Pour the eggs into a large bowl, add salt, and beat for at least 1 minute (or just do this in the measuring cup).</li>
            <li>Measure out water at the same volume as the eggs, and add it to the bowl. Do the same with the chicken stock. Whisk in the sesame oil, and make sure everything’s well combined.</li>
            <li>Pour the egg mixture through a fine mesh strainer into a shallow heatproof dish (a Pyrex pie plate works well).</li>
            <li>If any small bubbles remain, you can skim them off with a spoon or use your finger to pop them. The surface of the egg should be smooth and glassy.</li>
            <li>Fill your steaming set-up with just enough water to simmer for a few minutes. The water shouldn’t touch the dish of eggs. Bring to a boil.</li>
            <li>Once boiling, place the dish of eggs in the steamer, and cover. Keep the heat at medium-high to high. The water should be at a rapid simmer/boil.</li>
            <li>Steam the eggs for 3 minutes. After 3 minutes have elapsed, shut off the heat but keep the steamer covered. Let stand for 14 minutes with the lid firmly covered. Remove your steamed egg dishes from the steamer, sprinkle with scallions, and serve.</li>
        </ol>
